          <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
          <p>I earned a Bachelor of Science in Geology from the University of Calgary, where I became intrigued by the vast amount of data in the field. In my final year, I started questioning how large datasets could be used to interpret complex geological concepts, which piqued my interest in integrating data analysis.</p>

          <p>To explore this further, I took an introductory course in data science and quickly realized my passion for it. Graduating in 2020 during the challenges of COVID-19 and the downturn in the oil and gas industry, I saw an opportunity to pivot into data analytics. I became more engaged by participating in data-focused hackathons, gaining hands-on experience with real-world data and collaborating with professionals. These experiences not only strengthened my technical abilities but also allowed me to expand my network with like-minded individuals. Through this transition, I became an active volunteer with organizations such as the YYC Data Society, contributing to the data community and furthering my growth in the field.</p>
            
          <p>This led to my transition from working as an Environmental Lab Assistant to securing my first role as a Business Analyst at a startup. In 2023, I further strengthened my expertise by enrolling in SAIT’s Post-Diploma Certificate in Data Analytics, graduating with high honours. Shortly after, I landed a role as a Business Intelligence Analyst in the tech industry, where I gained real-world experience in data analysis, honing both my technical and soft skills to support business operations.</p>
            
          <p>I am passionate to continue growing and developing my expertise in advanced data analytics, AI integration, and business intelligence. My goal is to leverage data-driven insights to provide well-informed, optimized, and cost-effective business solutions that drive impactful decision-making.</p>
